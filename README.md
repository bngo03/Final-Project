# Final-Project

Up to this point, we have learned and discussed several machine learning algorithms. Now, it's time to put that knowledge into practice by applying these techniques to a problem of your own choosing. This could be any topic that sparks your interest!

To begin your project, consider areas you're passionate about, and look for publicly accessible datasets related to those interests.

You can explore the datasets/environments in Resources page under the Start Here module.

NOTE: The data or problem should be sufficiently complex, requiring a minimum of approximately 10,000 samples and at least 5 features.  


The project requires a comprehensive machine learning pipeline, including: data exploration and analysis with appropriate visualizations; preprocessing (with explanations if not needed); selection of machine learning algorithms (at least two ML algorithms) with a rationale for each choice; and detailed observation and analysis of results, discussing whether the model performs as expected and identifying potential improvements.
